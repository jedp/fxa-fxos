## Implementation Timeline

For 1.3, we are targeting:

- DOM API for sign-in

      `navigator.id.watch({wantIssuer: "firefox-accounts"});`

      `navigator.id.request();` &rarr; assertion

- IAC API for certified apps (FTE, Settings)

For 1.4 and beyond:

- a way for third-party services to participate (e.g., contacts sync service)
- a way for third-party non-certified apps to participate (sign-in request)
